Middle ware is the code that runs during the request and response..
That means it runs before the completion of router request
middle ware can be used for authentication by matching tokens
One should import NextResponse from next/server

to get the redirect method
then 
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/name",request.url))


If we want that some page culd not be  accessewd then we could use config there


it should be writen like

export const config={

matcher:"/name,one can add more here"

}
but the pages inside inside the given name can be accessed . So for that one should use 


matcher:"/name/:path*"
